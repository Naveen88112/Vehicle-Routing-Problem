Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) Solver

Overview
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The goal is to optimize delivery routes for multiple vehicles, reducing travel distance and enhancing efficiency.

Features
- Problem Representation: Models VRP with multiple delivery locations and vehicles.
- Genetic Algorithm Implementation: Uses DEAP for evolutionary computation.
- Fitness Evaluation: Optimizes routes based on total travel distance.
- Mutation & Crossover: Ensures diversity in route solutions.
- Visualization: Displays optimized routes using Matplotlib.

Technologies Used
- Python
- DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
